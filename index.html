                <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting
                    Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life, epitomized by the Simpson
                    family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional
                    town
                    of Springfield and parodies American culture and society, television, and the human condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts
                    with
                    producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after
                    his
                    own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey
                    Ullman
                    Show on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time
                    show
                    and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its debut on December 17, 1989, 649 episodes of The Simpsons have been broadcast. It is the
                    longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television
                    series
                    in terms of seasons and number of episodes. The Simpsons Movie, a feature-length film, was released
                    in
                    theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. Then on October 30, 2007, a
                    video
                    game was released. Currently, The Simpsons is on its thirtieth season, which aired September 30,
                    2018. The Simpsons will be renewed for a thirty-first season, with Al Jean completing a Treehouse
                    of Horror XXIX script, though the date has yet to be announced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Simpsons received acclaim throughout its first nine or ten seasons, which are
                    generally considered its "Golden Age". Time named it the 20th century's best television series, and
                    Erik Adams of The A.V. Club named it "television's crowning achievement regardless of format". On
                    January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won
                    dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 31 Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards,
                    and
                    a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase "D'oh!" has been adopted into the English
                    language,
                    while The Simpsons has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms. However, it has
                    also been criticized for a perceived decline in quality over the years. <br> Source: Wikipedia
